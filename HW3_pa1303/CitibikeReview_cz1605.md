# Hi Princeaker
## a.Verify that the Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
## Your null hypothese is "Men and Women ride for equal duration". And your alternative hypothese is "Men and Women ride city bike for different average durations".
## I think the hypotheses are formulated correctly and they are very clear. But maybe also considering other more factors will make the hypotheses more interesting and complicated. For example, you can focus on the duration in the morning or on weekends.
## b.Verify that the data supports the project
## I saw you got the both duration data of men and women and ploted the histogram so I think they are enough to support the project since the hypotheses only focus on the duration.
## c.Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked
## Because both sample sizes of men and women are huge, I recommend you to use Z-test to test the difference of means of two samples.
## Good luck!
